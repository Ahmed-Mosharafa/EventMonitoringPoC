\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, the Social Media Monitoring module developed for the Automated Journalist App represents an exploration of methodologies in automated event detection and summarization. While it leverages established techniques like graph-based clustering and large language models, the project serves primarily as a practical investigation into how these methods can be applied to real-time social media data. The module achieved respectable results in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score on the Event2012 dataset, demonstrating its potential utility. However, there remains significant room for improvement, particularly in handling the complexities and noise inherent in social media data. This work lays a foundation for further refinement and testing, with the aim of developing more robust and reliable tools for automated journalism in the future.
