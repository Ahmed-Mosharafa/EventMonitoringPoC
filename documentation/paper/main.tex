\begin{abstract}
Event detection on social media platforms, particularly Twitter (now known as X), is critical for fields like journalism, public safety, and crisis management. This project implements a social media monitoring module within the Automated Journalist App to automatically detect and cluster relevant events with minimal human intervention. Leveraging key components of the EDT\textsubscript{BERT} model by \citet{edtbert}, we represent tweets as nodes in a graph, using structural and contextual similarities to identify clusters with the Markov Clustering (MCL) method. We then summarize these clusters using Google's FLAN-T5 model, producing concise summaries for seamless news integration. Our system achieves a precision of 85\%, a recall of 70\%, and an F1-score of 77\% on the Event2012 dataset, highlighting its effectiveness in real-time social media monitoring and its contribution to automated journalism.
